# Test task

Design and implement a RESTful API, backing service and data model to create bank accounts
and transfer money between them. Interaction with API will be using HTTP requests.

### Requirements
* Accounts are created by supplying a name and four-digit PIN code. Account number is automatically created.
* Once account is created one can Deposit, Withdraw or Transfer money between accounts.
* Any operation which deducts funds from the account needs to include the correct PIN code.
* A specific call will fetch all the accounts: the name and their current balance.
* APIs will use JSON payloads when applicable.
* Use in-memory database as a backing store.

### Recommendations
* Use any technologies you feel comfortable with, but it is recommended you set up your project using Spring Boot.
* Make use of best practices when implementing your code to ensure a high-quality result. Use dependency injection, avoid statics, immutable types, etc…
* However, keep it simple and to the point. Do not over-engineer. e.g. there is no need to add authorization layers.
